# Portfolio | [Sachin Gunjal]

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio. This website is designed to be a comprehensive introduction to my work and skills.

The site is structured into several key sections:
* **Home:** A landing page to welcome visitors.
* **About:** A brief introduction about myself, my background, and my interests.
* **Projects:** A curated gallery of my work, with links and descriptions.
* **Resume:** An online version of my professional resume.
* **Blogs:** A collection of articles and thoughts on topics I'm passionate about.

Feel free to browse the code to see how it's built!
